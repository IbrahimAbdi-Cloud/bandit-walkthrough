# Connect to bandit4
ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

# Navigate to inhere directory
cd inhere

# List all files
ls

# Check file types individually
file ./-file00
file ./-file01
# ... continue for all files

# More efficient: check all files at once
file ./-file*

# Alternative: use find with file type checking
find . -type f -exec file {} \;

# Once identified, read the ASCII text file
cat ./-file07


Solution
Use file ./-file* to check all files at once. Only one will show "ASCII text" - that's the file containing the password.
