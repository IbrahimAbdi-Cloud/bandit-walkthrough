# Connect to bandit1
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

# List files
ls

# Try regular cat (this won't work as expected)
cat -

# Use relative path to specify the file explicitly
cat ./-

# Alternative method using absolute path
cat /home/bandit1/-


Solution
Use cat ./- or the absolute path to read the file. The ./ explicitly tells the system we're referring to a file, not using - as a command option.
Key Learnings

Special characters in filenames and how they're interpreted
Using ./ for relative path specification
Understanding the difference between command options and filenames
Alternative methods: absolute paths
