# List files
ls

# Method 1: Use quotes
cat "spaces in this filename"

# Method 2: Use single quotes
cat 'spaces in this filename'

# Method 3: Use backslash escaping
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

# Method 4: Use tab completion (type 'cat sp' then press Tab)



Solution
Any of the quoted methods work. Tab completion is particularly useful as it automatically handles the escaping.
